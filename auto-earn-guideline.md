# Auto Earn Documentation Page - Task Requirements

## Task Overview
Create a comprehensive, user-friendly documentation page explaining Hubra's Auto Earn feature. This page should be appealing, non-technical, and help end users understand how Auto Earn works, its benefits, and associated risks.

## Target Audience
- **Primary**: End users (customers using the Hubra app)
- **Tone**: Professional but approachable
- **Technical Level**: Balanced (technical enough to be accurate, but accessible to non-technical users)

## Content Requirements

### 1. Introduction Section
**Purpose**: Hook the reader and explain what Auto Earn is at a high level

**Key Points to Include**:
- Auto Earn is Hubra's automated yield optimization feature
- Powered by "Hubra Copilot" - an intelligent system that manages your crypto assets
- Works with your embedded wallet (automatically created when you sign up)
- Fully automated - set it and forget it
- Designed to maximize your passive income with minimal effort

**Suggested Opening**:
Start with a compelling value proposition that emphasizes automation and passive income. Example: "What if your crypto could work for you 24/7, automatically finding the best earning opportunities while you sleep?"

### 2. How It Works Section
**Purpose**: Explain the mechanics in simple, understandable terms

**Key Points to Cover**:

#### A. The Setup Process
- Users need an embedded wallet (automatically created)
- One-time activation: Users delegate permission to Hubra Copilot
- Once activated, the system runs automatically in the background
- No daily management required

#### B. The Two-Layer Strategy System
Explain in simple terms:

**Layer 1: Smart Deposits**
- Hubra Copilot continuously monitors your wallet
- When it finds idle tokens (crypto sitting unused), it automatically deposits them into vetted lending protocols
- Only deposits tokens worth $5 or more (minimum threshold)
- Always chooses the highest-yield opportunities available

**Layer 2: Smart Migrations**
- Hubra Copilot monitors your existing earn positions
- When it finds a better opportunity (higher APY), it automatically migrates your funds
- Only migrates if the new opportunity offers at least 1% more APY
- Ensures the new pool is sustainable and can handle your position size
- Avoids pools with withdrawal cooldown periods

#### C. The Execution Process
- Runs automatically on a schedule (no user action needed)
- Analyzes your holdings and available opportunities
- Builds and signs transactions automatically
- Submits transactions to the blockchain
- Monitors transaction status
- Updates your portfolio automatically

**Visual Elements to Consider**:
- Simple flow diagram showing: Wallet → Analysis → Best Opportunity → Automatic Deposit/Migration
- Timeline showing the automated cycle

### 3. Benefits Section
**Purpose**: Clearly communicate the value proposition

**Key Benefits to Highlight**:

1. **Passive Income Generation**
   - Your crypto earns yield automatically
   - No need to manually research opportunities
   - Works 24/7, even when you're not checking the app

2. **Automatic Optimization**
   - Always finds the best available APY
   - Automatically migrates to better opportunities
   - Maximizes your returns without manual intervention

3. **Time Savings**
   - No need to monitor markets constantly
   - No need to manually move funds between protocols
   - Set it once and let it work

4. **Smart Risk Management**
   - Only uses vetted lending protocols
   - Checks pool sustainability before migrating
   - Avoids pools with withdrawal restrictions
   - Minimum thresholds prevent micro-transactions

5. **Liquidity**
   - No lockup periods
   - You can withdraw anytime
   - No surprises or hidden restrictions

6. **Transparency**
   - All transactions are recorded in your activity feed
   - You can see exactly what the system did and why
   - Full visibility into your positions

**Writing Tips**:
- Use bullet points for easy scanning
- Include specific examples where possible
- Emphasize the "set and forget" nature

### 4. Risks Section
**Purpose**: Be transparent about potential risks (builds trust)

**Key Risks to Address**:

1. **Smart Contract Risks**
   - Auto Earn interacts with various DeFi protocols
   - Smart contracts can have bugs or vulnerabilities
   - Explain that Hubra only uses vetted protocols, but risks exist

2. **Market Risks**
   - APY rates can change over time
   - Market conditions affect yield opportunities
   - Past performance doesn't guarantee future results

3. **Liquidity Risks**
   - Some pools may have liquidity constraints
   - Large withdrawals might affect pool dynamics
   - Hubra checks pool sustainability, but extreme market conditions can change this

4. **Delegation Risks**
   - By activating Auto Earn, you grant Hubra Copilot permission to execute transactions
   - Transactions are automated based on the strategy engine
   - You can revoke this permission at any time

5. **Technical Risks**
   - Blockchain transactions can fail
   - Network congestion might delay transactions
   - The system includes retry mechanisms, but failures are possible

6. **Regulatory Risks**
   - DeFi regulations are evolving
   - Tax implications vary by jurisdiction
   - Users should consult tax professionals

**Writing Tips**:
- Be honest and transparent
- Don't downplay risks, but also don't overstate them
- Emphasize that users can opt out anytime
- Include a disclaimer that this is not financial advice
