# 📊 Token Trends

Every day, **thousands of new tokens** launch on Solana. Most vanish instantly - no liquidity, no volume, no real buyers. Some are outright rugs.\
Centralized exchanges solve this by whitelisting tokens, but at the cost of freedom. Hubra takes a different approach:

<Info>
  **Our mission:** Give you **true freedom of choice** without compromising on safety.

Every token on Hubra’s Trends page must meet **hard minimum criteria**:

- 📈 **Market Cap:** ≥ \$1M
