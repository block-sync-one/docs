# Auto Earn

Auto Earn is Hubra's yield-bearing asset system. Deposit an asset, receive a ra{asset} token that grows in value over time.

No claiming rewards. No manual rebalancing. Your token appreciates as yield accrues.

<Info>
ra{asset} tokens use an exchange-rate model. The number of tokens you hold stays the same—their backing value increases as yield compounds.
</Info>

## How It Works

### 1. Deposit

Deposit a supported asset into Hubra. You receive ra{asset} in return.

**Example:**
- Deposit 1,000 USDC → receive 1,000 raUSDC

### 2. Yield Accrues

The rebalancer continuously optimizes your position across lending protocols. Yield compounds into the token value.

**Example:**
- After some time, 1 raUSDC = 1.04 USDC
- Your 1,000 raUSDC is now worth 1,040 USDC

### 3. Withdraw

Redeem your ra{asset} for the underlying asset plus all earned yield. Instant. No cooldowns.

## The Rebalancer

Every 30 minutes, the rebalancer:

1. **Fetches live APY data** from integrated protocols
2. **Applies safety filters** (TVL, dilution limits)
3. **Selects the highest-yield pool** that passes all checks
4. **Moves capital** to the winning strategy

This isn't passive diversification. The rebalancer actively chases the best yield while respecting safety constraints.

<Note>
If no pool passes safety checks or the API is unavailable, funds fall back to equal-weight allocation across all strategies.
</Note>

## Safety Controls

The rebalancer enforces strict rules:

| Check | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| **Minimum TVL** | Pool must have > $500k total value locked |
| **Dilution limit** | Your deposit can't exceed 0.5% of pool TVL |
| **Locked liquidity** | Respects protocol lock periods; only moves withdrawable funds |
| **On-chain simulation** | Transactions simulated before execution |

### Why Dilution Matters

Depositing into a small pool tanks the yield for everyone. The dilution guard prevents this.

**Example:** A $1M pool at 5.5% APY. If you deposit $500k, your share dilutes the yield significantly. The rebalancer avoids this by capping your position relative to pool size.

## Supported Assets

### Stablecoins (Lending Strategies)

| Token | Strategies |
|-------|-----------|
| raUSDC | Kamino, Drift, Jupiter |
| raUSDT | Kamino, Drift, Jupiter |
| raUSDS | Kamino, Drift, Jupiter |
| raUSDG | Kamino, Drift, Jupiter |
| raUSD1 | Kamino, Drift, Jupiter |

Each stablecoin vault automatically allocates to the highest-yield lending opportunity across these protocols.

### raSOL (Liquid Staking)

raSOL is a liquid staking token built on Sanctum. It follows the same exchange-rate model but earns staking rewards instead of lending yield.

---

## Exchange-Rate Model

Hubra's ra{asset} tokens don't rebase. Your balance stays constant; the value per token increases.

**How it works:**
- You hold 1,000 raUSDC
- Exchange rate starts at 1 raUSDC = 1 USDC
- Yield accrues → exchange rate becomes 1 raUSDC = 1.04 USDC
- Your 1,000 raUSDC is now worth 1,040 USDC

This model is used by cTokens (Compound), aTokens (Aave), and liquid staking tokens. No need to claim rewards—they're automatically reflected in your token's value.

## Fees

Currently:
- No management fee
- No performance fee
- No withdrawal fee

Fee mechanisms may be introduced in the future.

---

## Withdrawals

- **Instant** — no waiting period
- **No slippage** — redeem at current exchange rate
- **No cooldown** — withdraw anytime

---

## Risks

**Smart contract risk**: ra{asset} tokens rely on vault contracts and integrated protocols. Bugs or exploits are possible.

**Protocol risk**: The underlying lending protocols (Kamino, Drift, Jupiter) carry their own risks.

**Variable yield**: APY fluctuates based on market conditions and protocol rates.

**Depeg risk**: In extreme conditions, ra{asset} could temporarily trade below its backing value on secondary markets.

## FAQ

**How is this different from Copilot?**
Copilot moves your idle wallet funds into lending protocols. Auto Earn gives you a single token (ra{asset}) that represents an optimized, auto-rebalancing position. Different tools for different use cases.

**Can I trade ra{asset} tokens?**
Yes. They're standard tokens you can transfer, trade, or use as collateral in DeFi.

**How often does rebalancing happen?**
Every 30 minutes, plus whenever new deposits are detected.

**What if the best pool changes mid-cycle?**
The rebalancer catches it on the next cycle and migrates funds if the improvement is significant.

**Is there a minimum deposit?**
No hard minimum, but very small deposits may not be cost-effective due to transaction fees.
