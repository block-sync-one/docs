### 📊 The Two-Layer Strategy

Hubra Copilot uses an intelligent two-layer approach to optimize your assets:

#### Layer 1: Smart Deposits

Hubra Copilot continuously monitors your wallet for idle tokens—crypto sitting unused that could be earning yield:

- **Automatic Detection**: Scans your wallet for tokens worth $5 or more
- **Best Opportunity Selection**: Always chooses the highest-yield lending protocol available
- **Instant Deployment**: Automatically deposits idle funds into vetted protocols
- **Minimum Thresholds**: Only moves tokens worth $5 or more to avoid micro-transactions

#### Layer 2: Smart Migrations

Hubra Copilot doesn't just deposit—it also optimizes your existing positions:

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Tracks all your active earn positions
- **Opportunity Detection**: Identifies when better yields become available
- **Smart Migration**: Automatically moves funds to higher-yield opportunities
- **Safety Checks**: Only migrates if:
  - The new opportunity offers at least **1% more APY**
  - The new pool is sustainable and can handle your position size
  - The pool has no withdrawal cooldown periods

<Info>
Hubra Copilot ensures your funds are always in the best available opportunity, automatically migrating when better options appear.

### 🔄 The Execution Process

Here's what happens automatically in the background:

1. **Analysis**: Hubra Copilot analyzes your wallet holdings and available opportunities
2. **Strategy Building**: Determines the best actions (deposits or migrations)
3. **Transaction Building**: Creates optimized transactions
4. **Signing**: Signs transactions using your delegated permissions
5. **Submission**: Submits transactions to the blockchain
6. **Monitoring**: Tracks transaction status and confirms completion
7. **Portfolio Update**: Automatically updates your portfolio with new positions

All of this happens automatically on a schedule—no user action required.

## ⚠️ Risks

Auto Earn is designed with safety in mind, but it's important to understand the risks involved:

### 🔐 Smart Contract Risks

Auto Earn interacts with various DeFi protocols. While Hubra only uses vetted protocols, smart contracts can have bugs or vulnerabilities. These risks are inherent to DeFi participation.

### 📈 Market Risks

- **Variable APY**: Yield rates can change over time based on market conditions
- **Market Volatility**: Market conditions affect available yield opportunities
- **No Guarantees**: Past performance doesn't guarantee future results

### 💧 Liquidity Risks

- **Pool Constraints**: Some pools may have liquidity constraints
- **Large Withdrawals**: Very large withdrawals might affect pool dynamics
- **Market Conditions**: Extreme market conditions can change pool sustainability

<Warning>
Hubra checks pool sustainability before migrating, but market conditions can change rapidly.
</Warning>

### 🔑 Delegation Risks

By activating Auto Earn, you grant Hubra Copilot permission to execute transactions on your behalf:

- **Automated Transactions**: Transactions are executed automatically based on the strategy engine
- **Revocable**: You can revoke this permission at any time
- **Transparent**: All transactions are visible in your activity feed

### 🔧 Technical Risks

- **Transaction Failures**: Blockchain transactions can fail due to network congestion or other issues
- **Network Delays**: Network congestion might delay transactions
- **Retry Mechanisms**: The system includes retry mechanisms, but failures are possible

### 📋 Regulatory Risks

- **Evolving Regulations**: DeFi regulations are still evolving
- **Tax Implications**: Tax implications vary by jurisdiction
- **Professional Advice**: Consult with tax professionals about your specific situation

<Warning>
This is not financial advice. Always do your own research and consult with financial professionals before making investment decisions.
