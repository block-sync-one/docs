# Auto Earn

Deposit an asset, receive a ra{asset} token that grows in value over time.

No claiming rewards. No manual management. Your token appreciates as yield accrues.

<Info>
ra{asset} tokens use an exchange-rate model. The number of tokens you hold stays the same—their backing value increases as yield compounds.

## How It Works

### 1. Deposit

Deposit a supported asset into Hubra. You receive ra{asset} in return.

**Example:**
- Deposit 1,000 USDC → receive ~1,000 raUSDC (exact amount depends on current exchange rate)

Since raUSDC appreciates over time as yield accrues, 1 raUSDC becomes worth more than 1 USDC. This means later depositors receive slightly fewer raUSDC per USDC deposited—but each raUSDC is worth proportionally more.

### 2. Yield Accrues

Hubra automatically optimizes your position across lending protocols. Yield compounds into the token value.

**Example:**
- After some time, 1 raUSDC = 1.04 USDC
- Your 1,000 raUSDC is now worth 1,040 USDC

### 3. Withdraw

Redeem your ra{asset} for the underlying asset plus all earned yield. Instant. No cooldowns.

## Why ra{asset}?

Your token balance stays the same. The value per token increases.

- **No claiming** — yield is automatically reflected in token value
- **No rebasing** — your balance doesn't change
- **Fully transferable** — use ra{asset} anywhere (trade, collateral, DeFi)

This is the same model used by popular tokens like cTokens and aTokens.

## FAQ

**How is this different from Copilot?**
Copilot moves idle wallet funds into lending protocols. Auto Earn gives you a single token (ra{asset}) that represents an optimized position.

**Can I trade ra{asset} tokens?**
Yes. They're standard tokens you can transfer, trade, or use as collateral.

**Is there a minimum deposit?**
No minimum.
