2. Enter the amount to unstake (full or partial)

</Tip>

<Warning>
If price impact exceeds 5%, you'll see a warning. Consider unstaking in smaller amounts.
</Warning>

## Partial unstake

Unstake any amount - you don't have to unstake everything at once.

**Example:** You have 100 SOL staked. Unstake 30 SOL instantly, keep 70 SOL earning rewards.

### How it works

1. Enter an amount less than your total staked balance
2. Hubra splits your stake account automatically
3. The unstaked portion converts to SOL instantly
4. The rest keeps earning staking rewards

<Info>
Minimum unstake amount: 0.01 SOL

## Why instant unstake?

Traditional Solana unstaking requires a 2-3 day cooldown period. Hubra's instant unstake uses Sanctum's liquidity pools to give you SOL immediately.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why are there fees?">
    Two fees apply: Hubra's platform fee (0.2%) and Sanctum's liquidity fee (0.1-0.5%). Sanctum provides the instant liquidity by swapping your stake for SOL from their pools.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is there a minimum unstake amount?">
    Yes, 0.01 SOL minimum. For partial unstakes, the remaining balance must cover rent exemption (~0.002 SOL).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What is price impact?">
    Price impact occurs when unstaking large amounts relative to available liquidity. Higher price impact means you receive slightly less SOL. The app warns you if impact exceeds 5%.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I unstake everything at once?">
    Yes. Enter your full staked balance to unstake everything instantly.
