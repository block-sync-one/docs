# Instant Unstake

Hubra lets you unstake your SOL instantly - no waiting for the standard 2-3 day Solana cooldown. Powered by [Sanctum](https://sanctum.so).

## How it works

1. Select your stake account
2. Enter the amount to unstake (full or partial)
3. See the output amount and fees
4. Confirm the transaction
5. SOL arrives in your wallet within seconds

<Info>
Hubra covers all network fees. You only pay the Sanctum liquidity fee.

## Fees

| Fee | Amount | Who pays |
|-----|--------|----------|
| Sanctum fee | 0.1-0.5% | You |
| Network fee | ~0.000005 SOL | Hubra (gasless) |

The exact Sanctum fee depends on available liquidity. You'll see the fee before confirming.

<Warning>
If price impact exceeds 5%, you'll see a warning. Consider unstaking in smaller amounts.
</Warning>

## Partial unstake

Unstake any amount - you don't have to unstake everything at once.

**Example:** You have 100 SOL staked. Unstake 30 SOL instantly, keep 70 SOL earning rewards.

### How it works

1. Enter an amount less than your total staked balance
2. Hubra splits your stake account automatically
3. The unstaked portion converts to SOL instantly
4. The rest keeps earning staking rewards

### Additional fees for partial unstake

| Fee | Amount | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| Account rent | ~0.002 SOL | One-time fee for creating split account |

<Info>
Minimum unstake amount: 0.01 SOL

## Why instant unstake?

Traditional Solana unstaking requires a 2-3 day cooldown period. Hubra's instant unstake uses Sanctum's liquidity pools to give you SOL immediately. The small fee (0.1-0.5%) is the cost for instant liquidity.
