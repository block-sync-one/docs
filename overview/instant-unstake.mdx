### Fees

| Fee | Amount | Who pays |
|-----|--------|----------|
| Sanctum fee | 0.1-0.5% | You |
| Network fee | ~0.000005 SOL | Hubra (gasless) |

The exact Sanctum fee depends on available liquidity. You'll see the fee before confirming.

<Warning>
If price impact exceeds 5%, you'll see a warning. Consider unstaking in smaller portions for large amounts.
</Warning>

## Partial unstake

Unstake any amount - you don't have to unstake everything at once.

**Example:** You have 100 SOL staked. Unstake 30 SOL instantly, keep 70 SOL earning rewards.

### How it works

1. Enter an amount less than your total staked balance
2. Hubra splits your stake account automatically
3. The unstaked portion converts to SOL instantly
4. The remaining stake keeps earning rewards

### Fees

| Fee | Amount | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| Account rent | ~0.002 SOL | One-time fee for creating split account |
| Sanctum fee | 0.1-0.5% | Liquidity fee |
| Network fees | Covered | Hubra pays (gasless) |

<Info>
Minimum unstake amount: 0.01 SOL

## FAQ
