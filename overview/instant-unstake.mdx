## Slow unstake

Standard Solana unstaking. Your SOL goes through the native cooldown period.

**How it works:**
1. Select your stake account
2. Choose "Slow" mode
3. Confirm the deactivation
4. Wait 2-3 days (1 full epoch)
5. Withdraw your full SOL amount

### Fees

| Fee | Amount | Who pays |
|-----|--------|----------|
| Sanctum fee | None | - |
| Network fee | ~0.000005 SOL | Hubra (gasless) |

<Tip>
The app shows how much more SOL you get with Slow mode. Use this to decide if waiting is worth it.
</Tip>

## Partial unstake

Unstake any amount - you don't have to unstake everything at once.

**Example:** You have 100 SOL staked. Unstake 30 SOL, keep 70 SOL earning rewards.

### How it works

1. Enter an amount less than your total staked balance
2. Choose Instant or Slow mode
3. Hubra splits your stake account automatically
4. The unstaked portion processes, the rest keeps earning

### Fees

| Fee | Amount | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| Account rent | ~0.002 SOL | One-time fee for creating split account |
| Sanctum fee | 0.1-0.5% | Only if using Instant mode |
| Network fees | Covered | Hubra pays (gasless) |

<Info>
Minimum unstake amount: 0.01 SOL

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why is Instant unstake output less than Slow?">
    Instant unstake uses Sanctum's liquidity pools to swap your stake for SOL immediately. This convenience comes with a small fee (0.1-0.5%). Slow unstake uses native Solana deactivation with no intermediary fees.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How long does Slow unstake take?">
    2-3 days. Solana requires stake to be deactivated for one full epoch before withdrawal. Epoch duration is approximately 2-3 days.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I cancel an unstake?">
    Instant: No, it's immediate. Slow: Yes, you can re-delegate before the cooldown completes.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is there a minimum unstake amount?">
    Yes, 0.01 SOL minimum. For partial unstakes, the remaining balance must cover rent exemption (~0.002 SOL).
