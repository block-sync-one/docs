## Overview

Hubra Earn lets you put your assets to work in two ways:

1. **Browse opportunities** — Compare yields across protocols
2. **Deposit into ra{asset}** — Get a yield-bearing token that appreciates automatically

---

## Yield-Bearing Assets (YBA)

When you deposit into Hubra, you receive **ra{asset}** tokens—yield-bearing assets that grow in value over time.

<Info>
ra{asset} tokens use an exchange-rate model. Your token count stays the same—the value per token increases as yield compounds.
</Info>

### How It Works

**1. Deposit**

Deposit a supported asset. You receive ra{asset} in return.

- Deposit 1,000 USDC → receive ~1,000 raUSDC
- The exact amount depends on the current exchange rate (later depositors receive slightly fewer tokens, but each token is worth more)

**2. Yield Accrues**

Hubra optimizes your position across lending protocols. Yield compounds into the token value.

- After some time: 1 raUSDC = 1.04 USDC
- Your 1,000 raUSDC is now worth 1,040 USDC

**3. Withdraw**

Redeem ra{asset} for the underlying asset plus all earned yield. Instant. No cooldowns.

### Why ra{asset}?

- **No claiming** — yield automatically reflected in token value
- **No rebasing** — your balance doesn't change
- **Fully transferable** — trade, use as collateral, or move anywhere

### Supported Assets

**Stablecoins:** raUSDC, raUSDT, raUSDS, raUSDG, raUSD1

**SOL:** raSOL (liquid staking via Sanctum)

## FAQ

**How is this different from Copilot?**

Copilot automatically moves idle wallet funds into yield. Earn lets you manually deposit into specific opportunities or ra{asset} tokens.

**Can I trade ra{asset} tokens?**

Yes. They're standard tokens—transfer, trade, or use as collateral anywhere.

**Is there a minimum deposit?**

No minimum.
