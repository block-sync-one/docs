# Earn

Deposit an asset into Hubra. Receive a ra{asset} token in return. That token grows in value as yield accrues.

No claiming rewards. No manual management. Hold the token and its value increases.

## How ra{asset} tokens work

When you deposit, you receive ra{asset} tokens based on the current exchange rate.

The token uses an exchange-rate model: your balance stays the same, but each token becomes worth more over time as yield compounds.

**Example:**
- You deposit 1,000 USDC
- You receive raUSDC based on the current rate (if 1 raUSDC = 1.01 USDC, you get ~990 raUSDC)
- Over time, 1 raUSDC might equal 1.05 USDC
- Your raUSDC balance stays at ~990, but it's now worth ~1,040 USDC

<Info>
This is the same model used by lending tokens like cTokens and aTokens. Your balance doesn't change. The value per token increases.
</Info>

## Why this model

- **No claiming** — yield shows up in the token value automatically
- **No rebasing** — your balance stays constant
- **Fully transferable** — use ra{asset} anywhere: trade it, use as collateral, move between wallets

## Withdraw anytime

Redeem your ra{asset} for the underlying asset plus earned yield. No lockups. No cooldowns.

## Supported assets

**Stablecoins:**
- raUSDC
- raUSDT  
- raUSDS
- raUSDG
- raUSD1

Yield comes from lending protocols like Kamino, Drift, and Jupiter.

**raSOL:**
Liquid staking token built on Sanctum. Earns staking rewards.

## Auto optimization

Hubra automatically moves your position to higher-yield opportunities when they appear. You don't need to monitor rates or manually migrate between protocols.

Migration only happens when:
- The new opportunity offers at least 1% more APY
- The pool can handle your position size
- There's no withdrawal cooldown

All transactions appear in your activity feed with explanations of what happened and why.

## Risks

**Smart contract risk:** Hubra uses vetted protocols, but DeFi contracts can have bugs.

**Variable rates:** APY changes based on market conditions. Past rates don't guarantee future returns.

**Liquidity:** Large withdrawals during extreme market conditions might affect timing.
