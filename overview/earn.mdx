Hubra Earn automatically puts your crypto to work across the best yield opportunities on Solana. You deposit, we handle the rest.

## How it works

When you deposit an asset into Hubra Earn, you receive a **ra** token in return.

- Deposit SOL → receive raSOL
- Deposit USDC → receive raUSDC
- Deposit USDT → receive raUSDT

Your rasymbol token represents your share of a yield-generating vault. As the vault earns yield, your token becomes worth more over time.

### The exchange-rate model

Here's the key concept: **ra tokens appreciate in value.**

You don't need to claim rewards or reinvest manually. The value backing each token increases automatically as yield accrues.

**Example:**

Let's say you deposit USDC when the exchange rate is 1 raUSDC = 1.00 USDC.

A few months later, after yield has accumulated, the rate might be 1 raUSDC = 1.04 USDC.

Your raUSDC balance stays the same, but each token is now worth 4% more. When you withdraw, you get back more USDC than you deposited.

This model is similar to how Aave's aTokens or Compound's cTokens work — your balance doesn't change, but its value does.

## What happens behind the scenes

Hubra doesn't just park your funds in one place. The system actively optimizes where your assets are deployed.

### Copilot: the decision engine

Copilot is the brain that manages yield optimization. Every 30 minutes, it:

1. **Scans available opportunities** - lending protocols, liquidity pools, staking options
2. **Applies safety filters** - only considers pools with sufficient TVL and liquidity
3. **Picks the best option** - selects the highest-yielding strategy that passes all checks
4. **Triggers rebalancing** - moves funds to capture the better rate

You don't have to monitor rates, compare protocols, or manually move funds. Copilot handles it.

### Fully automated & permissionless

The rebalancer runs autonomously. No manual intervention, no human operators deciding where funds go.

Every rebalance follows the same logic:
- Fetch live yield data
- Apply safety filters
- Pick the highest-yield pool that passes all checks
- Execute the move

This happens 24/7, whether markets are up or down, weekday or weekend.

**Open source:** The rebalancer code is public. You can audit the logic, verify how decisions are made, and see exactly what runs under the hood.

## Withdrawals

You can withdraw anytime. No lockups, no cooldowns, no unstaking delays.

- The amount includes your original deposit plus all accumulated yield

Withdrawals are instant and don't incur slippage.

## FAQ

### Do I need to claim rewards?

No. Yield accrues automatically into your rasymbol token value. There's nothing to claim or reinvest.

### How often does rebalancing happen?

Copilot evaluates opportunities every 30 minutes and rebalances when a better option is available.

### Is my principal at risk?

DeFi carries inherent risks including smart contract vulnerabilities and protocol failures. Hubra only allocates to audited protocols and enforces safety controls, but no yield product is risk-free. 

Only deposit what you can afford to have exposed to DeFi risk.

### Why did I receive slightly less rasymbol than I deposited?

ra{symbo}l tokens appreciate over time, so the exchange rate isn't always 1:1. If you deposit when 1 raUSDC = 1.02 USDC, your 100 USDC gets you ~98 raUSDC. This is normal — you're buying into accumulated yield.
