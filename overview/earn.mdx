## Scope of Aggregation

Currently, Hubra integrates with:

- **Lulo**
- **Kamino**
- **Drift**
- **Save**

By default, Hubra shows the **best-yield opportunity per asset type**.\
Users who want to go deeper can unlock the **comprehensive filter system**, which displays similar strategies from multiple providers for the same asset.

---

## User Flow

1. **Discover** – Browse curated opportunities with clear details:
   - APY %
   - Protocol tag
   - Locking/unlocking times
   - Strategy type
2. **Deposit** – When you choose an opportunity, Hubra directly calls the provider’s API.
   - Hubra itself **never holds your funds**.
   - You interact with the protocol directly, using Hubra only as the UI layer.
3. **Track & Withdraw** – Once deposited, your positions sync into your **Portfolio page** for ongoing tracking and easy withdrawal.

## Cross-Platform Design

The Earn experience is consistent across **web, PWA, and Solana Mobile**.\
Only small layout adjustments are made between large and small screens — the flow stays the same.
