Hubra Earn automatically puts your crypto to work across the best yield opportunities on Solana. You deposit, we handle the rest.

---

## How it works

### 1. Deposit

Deposit any supported asset into Hubra Earn. Your funds immediately start generating yield.

### 2. Track your balance

In the Hubra app, you'll see your **original asset** (USDC, SOL, etc.) in the tokens tab — not a new token symbol.

Tap on the asset to see:

- **Idle balance** - funds sitting in your wallet
- **Earning balance** - funds actively generating yield
- **Current APY** 0 the rate you're earning right now

### 3. Yield accrues automatically

Behind the scenes, Hubra uses an exchange-rate model. Your earning balance appreciates over time as yield compounds — no claiming or reinvesting needed.

### 4. Withdraw anytime

Pull out whenever you want. No lockups, no cooldowns. You get your original deposit plus all accumulated yield.

## What happens behind the scenes

Hubra doesn't just park your funds in one place. The system actively optimizes where your assets are deployed.

### The exchange-rate model

Under the hood, your earning balance is represented by **ra tokens** (raUSDC, raSOL, etc.). These tokens appreciate in value as yield accrues.

**Example:**

You deposit 100 USDC. Over time, as yield accumulates, that position might be worth 104 USDC - even though you never claimed anything.

You don't see ra tokens in the Hubra app — we show you the actual dollar value. But the math works the same as Aave's aTokens or Compound's cTokens.

### Fully automated & permissionless

The rebalancer runs autonomously. No manual intervention, no human operators deciding where funds go.

**Open source:** The rebalancer code is public. You can audit the logic, verify how decisions are made, and see exactly what runs under the hood.

## Security & Risk

Hubra Earn is built on top of [Ranger Finance](https://ranger.finance) — an institutional-grade vault infrastructure designed for professional asset managers and hedge funds.

### Non-custodial architecture

Ranger vaults operate on a **non-custodial basis**. For fully on-chain strategies, neither Hubra nor Ranger can withdraw user deposits. Strategy execution is restricted to whitelisted protocols and functions, ensuring your funds remain under programmatic control at all times.

### Audited smart contracts

Ranger's vault infrastructure has undergone multiple professional security audits:

| Component        | Auditor    | Status   |
| ---------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Vault Program    | Sec3 X-RAY | ✅ Passed |
| Adapter Programs | Sec3 X-RAY | ✅ Passed |
| Vault Program    | FYEO       | ✅ Passed |

### Whitelisted protocol integrations

Funds can only interact with pre-approved, audited protocols through Ranger's adapter system:

- **Lending:** Kamino, Drift, Jupiter

### Transparency

All vault positions and protocol interactions are visible on-chain. You can verify exactly how yield is generated and assess the protocols involved at any time.

### Understanding the risks

While Hubra employs institutional-grade infrastructure and only allocates to audited protocols, DeFi carries inherent risks:

- **Smart contract risk** - vulnerabilities in underlying protocols
- **Protocol risk** - potential failures in integrated DeFi platforms
- **Market risk** - fluctuations in asset values and yields

<Warning>
  Only deposit what you can afford to have exposed to DeFi risk. No yield product is completely risk-free.
</Warning>

## Supported assets

### Stablecoins

Stablecoin strategies use automated lending across Kamino, Drift, and Jupiter:

- **USDC**
- **USDT**
- **USDS**
- **USDG**
- **USD1**

---

## External Wallet Users

If you connect an external wallet (Phantom, Backpack, etc.) and deposit into Earn, you may see a token called `raXXXX` (e.g., raUSDC, raSOL) appear in your wallet app.

<Warning>
  **Important:** Do not burn, transfer, or interact with this token outside of Hubra. This token represents your working capital in Hubra Earn. Removing it will result in loss of funds.
</Warning>

In the Hubra app, you won't see these ra tokens - we display your actual asset balance instead.

---

## Withdrawals

You can withdraw anytime. No lockups, no cooldowns, no unstaking delays.

When you withdraw:

- Your earning position is closed
- You receive the underlying asset at the current value
- The amount includes your original deposit plus all accumulated yield

Withdrawals are instant and don't incur slippage.

## FAQ

### Do I need to claim rewards?

No. Yield accrues automatically. There's nothing to claim or reinvest.

### How often does rebalancing happen?

Copilot evaluates opportunities every 30 minutes and rebalances when a better option is available.

### Is my principal at risk?

DeFi carries inherent risks including smart contract vulnerabilities and protocol failures. Hubra only allocates to audited protocols and enforces safety controls, but no yield product is risk-free.

Only deposit what you can afford to have exposed to DeFi risk.

### Why does my external wallet show a different token?

External wallets display the raw ra tokens (raUSDC, raSOL, etc.) that represent your position. The Hubra app converts this to show your actual asset value instead.
