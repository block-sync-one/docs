# Copilot

Your idle crypto sitting in your wallet earns nothing. Copilot changes that.

Hubra Copilot automatically deposits your idle tokens into the highest-yield lending opportunities and moves them when better rates appear. You enable it once, and it handles everything from there.

<Info>
Copilot works with your embedded wallet only. Once activated, it runs 24/7—no manual intervention needed.

## What Copilot Does

Copilot has two jobs:

### 1. Deposit Idle Tokens

When tokens sit unused in your embedded wallet, Copilot finds the best lending protocol and deposits them automatically.

- Detects tokens worth $5 or more
- Selects the highest-yield opportunity available
- Deposits without you lifting a finger

### 2. Move to Better Yields

Copilot doesn't stop at the first deposit. It continuously monitors your positions and migrates funds when significantly better rates appear.

- Tracks all your active positions
- Moves funds when a new opportunity offers at least 1% higher APY
- Only migrates to pools with no withdrawal cooldowns

## How to Enable

One-time setup through a simple wizard:

1. **Open Copilot** in the Hubra app
2. **Review the wizard** — explains what Copilot does
3. **Grant permission** — allows Copilot to sign transactions on your behalf
4. **Deposit funds** to your embedded wallet
5. **Done** — Copilot takes over

<Tip>
You can revoke permission anytime in Settings. Your funds stay in their current positions; Copilot just stops managing them.

## What You Control

**Enable/Disable**: Turn Copilot on or off anytime. No penalties.

**Deposits**: Transfer any supported token to your embedded wallet. Copilot handles the rest.

**Withdrawals**: Withdraw anytime from your portfolio. No lockups, no cooldowns.

---

## Safety

Copilot only uses vetted lending protocols:

- **Vetted protocols only** — thoroughly reviewed before integration
- **Pool checks** — verifies pools can handle your position size
- **No lockup pools** — avoids pools with withdrawal restrictions
- **Minimum thresholds** — skips micro-transactions under $5

---

## What You See

Your portfolio shows:

- **Total balance** earning yield
- **Current positions** with APY for each
- **Activity feed** — every action Copilot takes, with explanations

All transactions are visible. Nothing happens in the dark.

## Risks

**Smart contract risk**: Copilot interacts with DeFi protocols. While only vetted protocols are used, smart contracts can have bugs.

**Variable APY**: Yields change based on market conditions. No guaranteed returns.

**Delegation**: You're granting Copilot permission to transact on your behalf. This is revocable anytime.

## FAQ
