# Copilot

Your idle crypto sitting in your wallet earns nothing. Copilot changes that.

Hubra Copilot automatically deposits your idle tokens into the highest-yield lending opportunities and moves them when better rates appear. You enable it once, and it handles everything from there.

<Info>
  Copilot works with your embedded wallet only. Once activated, it runs 24/7—no manual intervention needed.

## What Copilot Does

### Deposit Idle Tokens

When tokens sit unused in your embedded wallet, Copilot finds the best lending protocol and deposits them automatically.

- Detects idle tokens in your wallet
- Selects the highest-yield opportunity available
- Deposits without you lifting a finger
