title: "Staked SOL yield"
---

Stake your SOL. Keep it liquid. Earn yield automatically.

raSOL is Hubra's liquid staking token. When you stake SOL on Hubra, you get raSOL back. This token earns staking rewards while staying usable across Solana DeFi.

---

## Why liquid staking?

Traditional SOL staking locks your tokens. Need to sell, move funds, or react to a market drop? You wait 2-3 days to unstake.

Liquid staking fixes this. With raSOL you:

- Earn staking rewards (~6% APY) like native staking
- Stay liquid: sell, swap, or use raSOL anytime
- Skip the wait: instant unstake available
- Use in DeFi: deposit raSOL as collateral or into yield strategies

You get staking yield without giving up flexibility.

## How raSOL works

### The exchange rate model

raSOL is a reward-bearing token. When you stake SOL, you receive raSOL at the current exchange rate. As staking rewards build up, the exchange rate goes up. Each raSOL becomes worth more SOL over time.

Your raSOL balance stays the same. Its value grows.

- No rewards to claim (yield accrues automatically)
- No manual compounding (it's built in)
- Simple tracking (just watch the exchange rate)

### Where does the yield come from?

raSOL is staked to the Hubra validator. The validator earns staking rewards from Solana (currently ~6% APY), and those rewards flow into the raSOL exchange rate.

raSOL runs on [Sanctum](https://sanctum.so) infrastructure, the same system behind many of Solana's top liquid staking tokens.

## Using raSOL in DeFi

raSOL is a Sanctum preferred partner token with deep liquidity across Solana.

- Kamino: Use raSOL as collateral for borrowing
- Loopscale: Deposit into yield strategies
- Save: Earn additional yield on your raSOL
- DEXs: Swap raSOL for any token instantly

### Sanctum integration

raSOL plugs into Sanctum's unified liquidity layer:

- Deep liquidity: swap large amounts without major slippage
- Cross-LST swaps: convert between raSOL and other LSTs (JitoSOL, mSOL, etc.)
- Instant unstake: powered by Sanctum's infrastructure

---

## Fees

- Staking SOL → raSOL: Free (gasless - on Hubra)
- Instant unstake: ~0.1-0.5% (varies with liquidity)
- Standard unstake: Free (2-3 day wait)
- Using raSOL in DeFi: No Hubra fee (protocol fees may apply)

No management fees. No performance fees.

## Risks

Liquid staking has risks. Know them before you stake.

- **Smart contract risk**

  raSOL relies on smart contracts. Built on audited Sanctum infrastructure, but any smart contract can have bugs. Only stake what you're comfortable exposing to DeFi.
- **Validator risk**

  raSOL stakes to the Hubra validator. If the validator has downtime or underperforms, rewards may be lower than expected. Hubra monitors performance to maintain competitive yields.
- **Temporary depeg**

  In extreme markets, raSOL might trade below its fair SOL value on DEXs. Usually temporary. You can always use instant unstake to redeem at the true exchange rate.
- **No slashing (currently)**

  Solana doesn't have validator slashing yet. If this changes, it could affect staked assets. This applies to all Solana staking, not just raSOL.

## FAQ

- **What's the current APY?**

  About 6% APY from Solana staking rewards. This fluctuates based on network conditions and validator performance.
- **Is there a minimum stake amount?**

  No. Stake any amount of SOL.
- **Do I need SOL for gas fees?**

  No. Hubra covers all network fees for staking and unstaking.
- **Can I see how much yield I've earned?**

  The Hubra app shows the current raSOL exchange rate. Compare it to when you staked to calculate your earnings.
- **Where is my SOL actually staked?**

  Delegated to the Hubra validator. The validator earns staking rewards from Solana, which flow into the raSOL exchange rate.
- **Can I use raSOL outside of Hubra?**

  Yes. raSOL is a standard SPL token. Use it on Kamino, Loopscale, Save, or any DEX.
- **What if I need my SOL during a crash?**

  That's the point. Instant unstake gets you SOL in seconds, or swap on any DEX. No waiting.
- **How is raSOL different from JitoSOL or mSOL?**

  Similar base yield. raSOL adds: gasless transactions on Hubra, integrated portfolio view, Sanctum preferred partner liquidity, and one-click DeFi access.
- **What if Hubra shuts down?**

  raSOL lives in your wallet. You own it regardless of Hubra. Swap on DEXs or use Sanctum directly to unstake.
