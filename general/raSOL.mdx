title: "🌞 raSOL Liquid Staking Token"
description: "Understand how liquid staking works on Solana, why raSOL matters, and the key addresses for developers."

Staking is the backbone of Solana. By staking SOL, you help secure the network and earn rewards.\
But in traditional staking, tokens are locked and can’t be used anywhere else. That’s where **Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)** come in.

<Info>
  **LSTs = Staked SOL + Accumulated Rewards**\
  They represent your staking position, growing in value over time as rewards accrue.
</Info>

## 🔑 What Makes raSOL Unique

raSOL is Hubra’s native LST — originally launched as **hubSOL** — designed to be both a **yield engine** and a **power source** for the app.

- **Stake SOL, Stay Liquid** → Earn validator rewards while keeping your tokens usable.
- **Boosted Opportunities** → Unlock extra multipliers in Earn and Loyalty League.
- **Stake Boost** → A share of Hubra platform fees is distributed back into raSOL, making it the first LST that accrues value beyond validator yield.

<Tip>
  raSOL isn’t just a staking token. It is the **fuel** that powers everything inside Hubra.
</Tip>

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Deposit SOL** → Stake SOL through the Solana Stake Pool program.
2. **Receive raSOL** → The pool mints raSOL into your wallet.
3. **Accrue Value** → raSOL increases in value as:
   - Validators generate staking rewards.
   - Hubra shares platform fees back into the pool.
4. **Stay Flexible** → Trade, lend, LP, or hold raSOL across DeFi.
5. **Redeem Anytime** → Swap raSOL back into SOL when you want to exit.

<Note>
  By holding raSOL, you’re both **staking securely** and **capturing platform revenue** — without ever compromising self-custody.
</Note>

## 💰 Why LSTs Trade Above SOL

Unlike SOL, which is a static token, LSTs like raSOL **accumulate rewards directly into their value**:

- Each raSOL represents **1 SOL + staking rewards** earned since it was minted.
- Over time, the **exchange rate increases** (e.g., 1 raSOL = 1.03 SOL).
- When you redeem raSOL, you always get back **more SOL than you originally deposited**, depending on accrued rewards.

<Note>
  This is why LSTs often appear **“more expensive”** than SOL on price charts.\
  They don’t inflate — they **grow** as rewards compound.
</Note>

## 🛡️ Security and Audits

raSOL is powered by the **Solana Stake Pool Program**, one of the most tested programs in the ecosystem:

- **Audited multiple times** by [Quantstamp](https://github.com/anza-xyz/security-audits/blob/master/spl/QuantstampStakePoolAudit-2021-10-22.pdf), [Kudelski](https://github.com/anza-xyz/security-audits/blob/master/spl/KudelskiStakePoolAudit-2021-07-07.pdf), [Neodyme](https://github.com/anza-xyz/security-audits/blob/master/spl/NeodymeStakePoolAudit-2023-11-14.pdf), [OtterSec](https://github.com/anza-xyz/security-audits/blob/master/spl/OtterSecStakePoolAudit-2023-01-20.pdf), and [Halborn](https://github.com/anza-xyz/security-audits/blob/master/spl/HalbornStakePoolAudit-2023-12-31.pdf).
- **Battle-tested** across millions of SOL staked by other LST protocols.
- **Non-custodial** → You hold raSOL directly in your wallet.
- **Transparent** → Every mint and redeem is visible on-chain.

<Warning>
  Unlike custodial “wrapped staking” solutions, raSOL never leaves the Solana staking framework.
</Warning>
